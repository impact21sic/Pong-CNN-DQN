# Pong-CNN-DQN
Gym pong environment solved by a simple DQN. Made it 2 weeks after implementing the Q-table - my introduction to the reinforcement learning. The model scores its first games at about the 150th episode and there are still symptoms of converging at the 300th episode! Yet, I haven't tested it further than that, but most of the time the models scores to victory after the 150th episode/game.
